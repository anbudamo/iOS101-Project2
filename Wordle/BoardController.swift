  // Exercise 5 Pt. 2 (optional): This function only needs to be implemented if you decide to do the optional requirement (see Pt. 1 in ViewController.swift)
  // This function should reset the board with the current settings without changing the goalWord

  // Exercise 1: Implement applyNumLettersSettings to change the number of letters in the goal word
  // Tip 1: Use a breakpoint to inspect or print the `settings` argument
  // Tip 2: There is a constant `kNumLettersKey` in Constants.swift that you can use as the key to grab the value in the dictionary
  // Tip 3: Assign the correct value of the setting to the `numItemsPerRow` property.
  // Tip 4: You will need to cast the value to the correct type
  // Checkpoint: Correctly implementing this should allow you to change the number of letters in the goal word!

          numItemsPerRow = numLetters

    // END YOUR CODE HERE
  }
  
  // Exercise 2: Implement applyNumGuessesSettings to change the number of rows in the board
  // Tip 1: Use a breakpoint to inspect or print the `settings` argument
  // Tip 2: There is a constant `kNumGuessesKey` in Constants.swift that you can use as the key to grab the value in the dictionary
  // Tip 3: Assign the correct value of the setting to the `numRows` property.
  // Tip 4: You will need to cast the value to the correct type
  // Checkpoint: Correctly implementing this should allow you to change the number of rows in the board!
  private func applyNumGuessesSettings(with settings: [String: Any]) {

      }
    // END YOUR CODE HERE
  }
  
  // Exercise 3: Implement applyThemeSettings to change the goal word according to the theme
  // Tip 1: There is a constant `kWordThemeKey` in Constants.swift that you can use as the key to grab the theme as a String in the dictionary
  // Tip 2: Pass-in the theme to `WordGenerator.generateGoalWord` (see WordGenerator.swift) and assign its result to the `goalWord` defined above
  //  - The value stored in the settings dictionary is a String, but `WordGenerator.generateGoalWord` expects a WordTheme type.
  //    Use the `WordTheme(rawValue:)` initializer to pass-in the string from the dictionary to get the correct type
  // Checkpoint: Correctly implementing this should allow you to change the theme of the goal word! Use breakpoints or print statements
  // to check the before/after value of goalWord and see if it changes to the correct theme
  private func applyThemeSettings(with settings: [String: Any]) {
    // START YOUR CODE HERE
    if let rawTheme = settings[kWordThemeKey] as? String, // same as we've been doing before

        goalWord = WordGenerator.generateGoalWord(with: theme)
    }
    // END YOUR CODE HERE
  }
  
  // Exercise 4: Implement applyIsAlienWordleSettings to change the goal word after each guess
  // Tip 1: There is a constant `kIsAlienWordleKey` in Constants.swift that you can use as the key to grab the value in the dictionary
  // Tip 2: There is a corresponding property located in this file that you should assign the value of the setting to (look at the "Properties" section above).
  // Checkpoint: Correctly implementing this function should change the goal word each time the user inputs an entire row of letters
  private func applyIsAlienWordleSettings(with settings: [String: Any]) {
    // START YOUR CODE HERE
      if let isAlienWordle = settings[kIsAlienWordleKey] as? Bool {
          self.isAlienWordle = isAlienWordle
